<p style="text-align:center;">
Animal cruelty has been a serious issue facing countries all around the world. For example, San Diego has an Aquarium Water Park called SeaWorld, which keeps whales and orcas in captivity to train them for people's entertainment. Not only that, they are denied the opportunity to engage in any natural behavior. Most of those animals die far short their natural life spans. This is only one issue in the world of animal cruelty. Some may involve testing make up on animals, or just the small things like hitting them because they did something wrong or what not.
<br/>
<br/>


Numerous organizations are speaking up about their advocacies through the Internet or through magazines, newspapers, and the like. In some cases, they even have talks to broaden people's knowledge about the topic. These organizations help people to realize the true meaning of animal cruelty.

<br/>
<br/>
Since advocacies on animal abuse are already widely known because of the numerous organizations there are promoting the rights of animals, all we can do is support and do what is right. If we see or hear anyone that is against it, tell him or her kindly the correct thing. Not only by educating people in the wrong, we can also volunteer in the local shelters by helping to take care of the animals.</p>
